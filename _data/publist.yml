  description: Herein we present ODACell, an automated electrolyte formulation and battery assembly setup, capable of preparing large batches of coin cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of Li-ion cell assembly in an ambient atmosphere by preparing LiFePO4‖Li4Ti5O12-based full cells with dimethyl sulfoxide-based model electrolyte. Furthermore, the influence of water is investigated to account for the hygroscopic nature of the non-aqueous electrolyte when exposed to ambient atmosphere.
