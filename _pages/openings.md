### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)). In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.**
